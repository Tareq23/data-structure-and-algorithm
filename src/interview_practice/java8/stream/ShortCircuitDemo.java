/**
 * 
 * # Java 8 Stream - Short Circuit Operations
 * 
 *  -> Java 8 short-circuit operations are just like boolean short-circuit evaluations in java.
 *  
 *  -> In boolean short-circuiting logic, for example firstBoolean && secondBoolean, if firstBoolean is true then the remaining part of the expression
 *     is ignored  (the operation is short-circuit) because the remaining evaluation will be redundant. Similarly in firstBoolean || secondBoolean, if 
 *     firstBoolean is true the remaining part is short-circuit
 *  -> Java 8 stream short-circuit are operations are not limited to boolean types. There are predefined short-circuit operations.
 *  -> Java 8 stream intermediate and terminal operations both can be short circuiting.
 *  -> Intermediate - limit()
 *  -> Terminal - findFirst(), findAny(), anyMatch(), allMatch(), noneMatch()
 *
